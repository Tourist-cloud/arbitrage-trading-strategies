🚀Arbitrage Trading Strategies
Maximize Profits with Algorithmic Trading

🌍 Overview
This project implements a high-frequency triangular arbitrage strategy to identify profitable opportunities in currency markets. The algorithm scans real-time exchange rates, calculates potential profit cycles, and executes trades automatically to capitalize on market inefficiencies.

🧠 How It Works
1. The algorithm starts with a base currency (e.g., USD).
2. It calculates the exchange rate cycles (e.g., USD → EUR → GBP → USD).
3. If the product of the rates exceeds the initial amount, an arbitrage opportunity is identified.
4. The algorithm executes trades and locks in the profit instantly.

⚙️  Key Features

🏆 Why This Works
1. Currency arbitrage relies on the fact that exchange rates between three currencies are not always perfectly aligned.
2. The algorithm takes advantage of these minor discrepancies to generate risk-free profits.
